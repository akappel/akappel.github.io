Hello and welcome to my blog! This is just a landing page to get myself acclimated to creating posts using Jekyll. It's taken me almost four months since creating the GitHub pages repo to actually push forward and write my first post. If that's any indication, my next post will land some time in August(?). Until then, thanks for visiting!
